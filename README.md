* Plug in #1 - Lightbox: Lightbox is a Javascript library that displays images and videos by filling the screen, and dimming out the rest of the webpage. It is often used to emphasize a portfolio. For my website, I used Lightbox to display my artwork. When you click on one of the small images, Lightbox opens and you can click right or left to view all of the work that I have created for clients and class assignments.
* [jQuery Plug In #2] (http://jscroll.com/)
* Plug in #2 - JScroll: JScroll is a jQuery plugin for infinite scrolling. Also known as "lazy scrolling" it allows people to "jump" to sections without having to actually scroll up and down the webpage. I used this effect at the top of my resume, and it allows the viewers to jump down to particular sections that they want to look at. You can also find it at the bottom right of my page where you can "Start At The Top!" and jump to the very beginning of the webpage.

# Comments
* The commits are placed closely together. That is because the size of my images were much larger than what GitHub currently allows and I had to abort all of the push messages to the GitHub repository and start fresh.
